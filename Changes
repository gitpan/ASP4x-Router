  - The mod_perl handler sets $r->pnotes(__routed => 1), which the ASP4::TransHandler
    now checks before performing any additional routing.  Otherwise we end up
    doing twice the work!

2010-03-26      v0.004
  - The logic used for finding/constructing the router is updated.
  - Updated POD.
  - Downgraded Apache2::RequestRec requirement to a 'recommends'.
  - Added dynamic inheritance based on whether requiring ASP4::TransHandler works or not.
  - ASP4x::Router now will test for the existence of each matched uri from $router->match(...)
    until it finds one that exists on disk.

2010-03-24      v0.003
  - Added prereq Apache2::RequestRec since that's needed for ASP4::TransHandler.
