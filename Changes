2012-02-12      v0.021
  - Added support for multiple external "routes.json" files.

2011-01-11      v0.020
  - There was a bug causing routes like "/{state_href:[^\\.]+}.asp" to work in a
    RequestFilter context but break under Apache.

2010-11-12      v0.019
  - All classes in config.app are now ->import'ed under non-mod_perl2 environment.

2010-05-20      v0.018
  - This release addresses several issues related to running multiple applications
    under different VirtualHosts on the same apache server.

2010-05-19      v0.017
  - Some versions of Apache httpd don't always set $r->hostname, which causes
    problems for us.  Declining those requests appears to be acceptable...let's see.

2010-04-27      v0.016
  - Now $ENV{REMOTE_ADDR} is set properly.

2010-04-13      v0.015
  - Properly sets $ENV{QUERY_STRING} when running in a mod_perl2 environment.

2010-04-10      v0.014
  - Fixed a bug that caused $Stash->{route} to not always be accessible.

2010-04-08      v0.013
  - $r->pnotes(route) is set even if we don't do routing.  This makes routing more consistent.

2010-04-06      v0.012
  - Handlers are now also covered by the "don't-route-if-the-file-actually-exists"
    logic from v0.010-v0.011.
  - Added tests to verify the new behavior.

2010-04-06      v0.011
  - Finished the whole "don't-route-if-the-file-actually-exists" thing that was
    started in v0.010
  - Requires ASP4 v1.025 because of a change in the way that $Config->web->router
    is setup (now it actually happens inside of ASP4::ConfigNode::Web.

2010-04-05      v0.010
  - If /foo/bar.asp is a real file on disk then route-matching will be skipped.

2010-04-05      v0.009
  - Sometimes get_router() was returning strange values - added a workaround to
    prevent this.

2010-04-01      v0.008
  - Miscellaneous bug fixes and minor enhancements all-around.

2010-03-29      v0.007
  - If we can't get a router object, ASP4x::Router will return "declined".

2010-03-27      v0.006
  - The TransHandler handler was not passing along $r->args properly.

2010-03-26      v0.005
  - The mod_perl handler sets $r->pnotes(__routed => 1), which the ASP4::TransHandler
    now checks before performing any additional routing.  Otherwise we end up
    doing twice the work!

2010-03-26      v0.004
  - The logic used for finding/constructing the router is updated.
  - Updated POD.
  - Downgraded Apache2::RequestRec requirement to a 'recommends'.
  - Added dynamic inheritance based on whether requiring ASP4::TransHandler works or not.
  - ASP4x::Router now will test for the existence of each matched uri from $router->match(...)
    until it finds one that exists on disk.

2010-03-24      v0.003
  - Added prereq Apache2::RequestRec since that's needed for ASP4::TransHandler.

2010-03-23      v0.002
  - Changed the email address in the config.
  - Updated the POD with examples and more description.

2010-03-23      v0.001
  - Original release.
